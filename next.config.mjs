  // `/pro` is a shell whose body comes from the optional module (see
  // `app/pro/page.tsx`). Without that module the page calls `notFound()`, which
  // renders the right thing — and answers **200**, which is the wrong status.
  //
  // The cause is `app/loading.tsx`. A root loading file wraps every route in a
  // Suspense boundary, so a dynamic page starts streaming its shell before the
  // component runs; by the time `notFound()` throws, the 200 has been sent.
  // That is true of any `notFound()` in this app, and removing the loading file
  // to fix one route would be a poor trade.
  //
  // So the route is taken away instead of refused. Rewriting to a path that
  // matches no file means Next never routes to the page at all, and answers its
  // own 404 — real status, and `app/not-found.tsx` for the body. Unmatched
  // routes are resolved before rendering, so no shell is streamed first.
  //
  // The destination is deliberately a path nothing will ever serve. If you add
  // a catch-all under `app/pro/`, this stops working and must be revisited.
