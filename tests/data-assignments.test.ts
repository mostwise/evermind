 * shortest thing to write, and left six call sites reporting success for writes
 * that never landed (audit H2).
 *
 * So the suite has two jobs: prove the right row is written on the happy path,
 * and prove that *every* write throws when the database says no, with a message
 * a user can act on and without leaking Postgrest's own wording.
 *
 * The Supabase client is replaced rather than the module under test, so these
