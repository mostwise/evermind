-- Automatic clean-up of completed assignments.
--
-- Two things, because neither is useful without the other:
--
--   1. `assignments.completed_at` — when a row was ticked off. The retention
--      clock has to start somewhere, and nothing in the schema recorded it.
--   2. `retention_settings` — how long each account keeps completed work.
--
-- ===========================================================================
-- WHY `completed_at` IS SET BY A TRIGGER AND NOT BY THE APPLICATION
-- ===========================================================================
--
-- The same reasoning as `handle_updated_at`, and the comment in
-- `lib/data/assignments.ts` that goes with it: a timestamp the client sends is
-- a timestamp every write path has to remember to send. There are already three
-- paths that can complete an assignment — the card menu, the edit dialog, and
-- `PATCH /api/v1/assignments/:id` in the commercial module — and the one that
-- forgets does not fail. It quietly writes a row whose deletion clock never
-- starts, or never stops.
--
-- So the database owns it. Complete a row and it is stamped; reopen it and the
-- stamp is cleared, which is what makes reopening a genuine reprieve rather
-- than a pause. Editing a row that is already complete leaves the stamp alone,
-- so fixing a typo in something you finished last week does not buy it another
-- month.
--
-- ===========================================================================
-- WHY THE BACKFILL USES NOW() AND NOT `updated_at`
-- ===========================================================================
--
-- `updated_at` is the obvious guess at when something was completed, and it is
-- a bad one here. For a row completed six months ago and untouched since, it
-- says six months ago — so the first sweep after this migration would delete it
-- immediately, along with most of the account's history, with no warning and no
-- undo. Guessing wrong in that direction is unrecoverable.
--
-- NOW() starts everyone's clock at the moment the feature arrives. It is not
-- the true completion date and does not pretend to be; it is the only value
-- that cannot destroy something the user has not been told about yet.
--
-- ===========================================================================
-- WHY `retention_settings` GETS SELECT AND NOTHING ELSE
-- ===========================================================================
--
-- Read the header of `pro/migrations/0001_purchases.sql` — this is the same
-- shape and the same reason. The browser holds a real Postgres role and talks
-- to PostgREST directly, so a `WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id)` update policy
-- would let anyone set their own retention from the console. Changing this is
-- what the commercial edition sells; the policy every account gets by default
-- is not negotiable from the client.
--
-- Two independent locks again: no write policies, and the write grants revoked,
-- so a policy added here by accident still cannot be exercised.
--
-- Self-hosting note: an instance with no commercial module has nothing that can
-- write this table through the application, and every account on it therefore
-- keeps the default. That is deliberate rather than an oversight — but whoever
-- runs that instance holds the service-role key, and
--
--   INSERT INTO retention_settings (user_id, enabled) VALUES ('<uuid>', false)
--   ON CONFLICT (user_id) DO UPDATE SET enabled = false;
--
-- turns it off for an account permanently. `docs/self-hosting.md` says so too.
--
-- Idempotent throughout, so it is safe to re-run.
